# What is Integration Really

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}  \sum_{x=a}^b f(x) \Delta x$$

$$\int_{{\,a}}^{{\,b}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {f\left( {x_i^*} \right)\Delta x} \hspace{0.25in}\hspace{0.25in}\hspace{0.25in}\Delta x = \frac{{b - a}}{n}$$

Integration is just summing the area under a curve. You take the value of the curve at a point (height) and then multiply it by an infinitesimally small increment in the input value (width) and then sum over all these increments.
