                    <li>This book gave me a lot of insight into how experts and savants developed their skills and the benefits of varied experience in navigating life and solving ill-defined/open ended problems.</li>
                    <li>Conventionally, when I teach myself something I like to see tangible results quickly. However, short term retention is actually a very bad indicator of how much you pick up in the long term. Apparently, slow and painful learning does the best at teaching something and having that stick with you.</li>
                    <li>I would like to improve my long term retention for things that I learn, and apparently this can be done with interleaved training. Interleaved and varied training is better than repeatedly doing the same task for long periods of time (block training). Block training you are primed to give a certain response, but with interleaved training you actually need to think about your response.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Enlighenment Now clearly explained many controversial topics as well as dispelled many misconceptions I had about the state of modern society. I feel much more knowledgable about what's going on in today's world and also more confident in the ability of our society to combat the major problems that the world faces.</li>
                    <li>Firstly, income inequality has indeed grown over time, however everyone's income (and buying power) has been rising. The wealth disparity should be addressed, but the standard of living for everyone continues to improve which I'm quite happy about.</li>
                    <li>I had a very negative perception of nuclear power prior to reading this book. As it turns out, the deaths resulting from harnessing nuclear power are miniscule compared to the number of deaths resulting from most kinds of other energy. Using nuclear power is also much more efficient than using other forms of energy, although the amount of carbon dioxide and methane released per unit of energy has dramatically decreased for all forms of energy.</li>
                    <li>Steven Pinker claims that the emphasis that we place on terrorist attacks reveals how benign society really is, since they make up a very small proportion of deaths (also that Terrorism is intended to provoke, whereas military force is intended to weaken).</li>
                    <li>Millennials use less drugs than Baby Boomers, despite common perceptions.</li>
                    <li>The best predictor of democratic values and emancipation in a society is the World Bank's knowledge index. This could imply a causal relationship between knowledge/progress and democracy where societies are all approaching democracy as they further develop (take this with a grain of salt).</li>
                    <li>Society has been improving over the long term, despite short term fluctuations. Progress is self-cloaking in that solving a problem gives rise to new ones.</li>
                    <li>I found this to be quite surprising: there is no correlation between people's understanding of climate change and whether or not they believe in it. Mostly, those who do not believe in climate change (or support Donald Trump for example) do so because of their personal values and identity, not due to a lack of understanding.</li>

                    <li>One of the most interesting things I recall from reading was: experiments have successfully shown that you can take a specialized adult cell and transform it back into a stem cell that can then differentiate into whatever you want.
                      Some of the applications of this are really crazy, like in the future we will be able to draw someones blood, convert those blood cells into some egg cells and sperm cells and then create a child made completely from that person. Freaky.</li>

                          <li>The author did a great job of demystifying who Leonardo was by extensive research through his journals. I was quite surprised to learn that Leonardo was an erratic and frenzied thinker, who never completed his commissioned work.</li>
                          <li>Leonardo had a fascinating mind, which the book explored intimately through Leonardo’s notebooks. His disorderly, meandering, and flurried notes posited some really odd questions that I never would have thought to ask. I was inspired to be more inquisitive about the way things work.</li>
                          <li>Leonardo curiosity drove him explore optics, anatomy, art, engineering and many other fields, and his knowledge in one field complemented his abilities in the next, making him a true polymath.</li>

                            <li>This book has had a pretty significant influence on my interests overall, what I chose study in college, and my career path, because it gave me a new, refreshing perspective of math. Before reading this book I thought that math was pretty boring, and I didn't have much of an interest in applying math to situations in my daily life or pursuing a career focused on building mathematical models.</li>
                            <li>Jordan Ellenberg illuminates many misconcpetions about math that I had growing up. You don't need to be a prodigy to be an accomplished mathematician, math is actually quite useful in every day life, and math can be fun.</li>
                            <li>Most importantly the book examines some problems that seem simple and boring at first, but when looked at through a mathematical perspective become quite interesting.</li>
                            <li>Some of my favorite questions this booked examined include: is there a definitive way to say that an elected candidate is the "correct" candidate, are there secret messages hidden in patterns within holy texts, and Buffon's needle.</li>

                            <li>In school, I found history to be pretty boring, because there wasn't much analysis on why events transpired. Instead, the focus in school was about what had happened. In this book, Harari uncompromisingly presents his opinions surrounding humanity's evolution, which makes the story of humanity so much more compelling.</li>
                            <li>I learned so much about how society has evolved since humans emerged from monkeys. The book also made me reflect on what makes us truly human and where humanity is headed in the future.</li>
