                  <ul>
                    <li>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)- is just a collection of base pairs (ATGC). Any combination is referred to as DNA. A DNA molecule is in the shape of a double helix</li>
                    <li>3 base pairs encode an amino acid. But there are only 20 amino acids in total (with 64 possible combinations of the three letter encodings), so some amino acids can be encoded with multiple base pair combinations.</li>
                    <li>Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins</li>
                    <li>Chromosome- They are bundles of tightly coiled DNA located within the nucleus of almost every cell in our body. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell, which make up the human genome.</li>
                    <li>Gene- A group of base pairs in DNA make up a gene.</li>
                    <li>Genes are structured like this where each word is a gene: "This...........is..............the................s.......tr.........uct......ure............of.........your..........gen.......ome"</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We have filler base pairs in between genes and within genes</li>
                      <li>Some of this information dictates when/how the gene should be activated or "turned on"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>RNA (ribonucleic acid)- is a collection of base pairs (AUGC) that carry instructions from the DNA for how to build proteins.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Different parts of DNA is turned into RNA based on what part of the body the cells are in because the information encoded in the DNA tells proteins which parts of the DNA should be active</li>
                      <li>Scientists were able to identify an enzyme that could convert RNA back to DNA, which allowed them to isolate which genes are "turned on" in which situations and parts of the body</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>DNA --> RNA --> proteins. Some of these proteins create chemicals that tell DNA to "turn on" some of its other genes and thus create RNA and proteins. This creates a circular structure where DNA makes proteins and then the proteins tell the DNA what to do.</li>
                    <li>Of the millions of biological molecules in the human body (including enzymes, receptors, hormones, etc.), only 250 or 0.025 percent are theraputically modulated by our current pharmacopeia.</li>
                    <li>Mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the mother and we can trace back the mitochondrial DNA for everyone back to the same single women hundreds of thousands of years ago.</li>
                    <li>Humans have less genetic diversity than apes and most other species (because we are younger)</li>
                    <li>The vast proportion of genetic diversity (85-90%) occurs within so-called races, not between them</li>
                    <li>Genes cannot tell us how to comprehend human diversity; environments, cultures, geographies, and histories can, but what they tell us is meaningless and arbitrary.</li>
                    <li>Dyslexia may have been a useful genetic variant in the past for allowing hunters to focus on multiple targets at once, but now in society it is an illness</li>
                    <li>Some people born with Swyer syndrome have XY chromosomes, but they develop and identify as female. This is because they have mutations in their SRY gene which controls flipping on the genes in the Y chromosome. Inserting extra SRY genes into rats turned their female offspring with XX into males.</li>
                    <li>Author consistently gives arguments and examples that genes (supported by twin studies) govern your propensity to respond or act a certain way (you can think of it as the gradient/first derivative), but not that actual outcome of how you act</li>
                    <li>Environmental impacts on genes can be passed down. For example, famine during WW2 in Netherlands “Hongerwinter” caused many of these people to be malnourished and the children of those who survived (and their children) were often obese and suffered heart disease later in life because they inherited genes from their parents with these epigenetic markers that allowed the parents to survive the famine.</li>
                    <li>The epigenome is what changes throughout a person’s life. The influence of “nurture” is only existing in how it is reflected back in the “nature”. The underlying genes are the same over time, but how they are packaged (histones) change</li>

                  <h3>SALT</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>How salty is the salt that you have? A tablespoon of fine salt will be much saltier than a tablespoon of coarser salt (since it’s more densely packed)</li>
                    <li>Cooking with salt is usually much more impactful than sprinkling salt on something after cooking it</li>
                    <li>Even if the type of salt is the same, the saltiness from different brands is huge</li>
                    <li>The rate at which salt dissolves in a dish when you cook it is very important. Salt needs time to dissolve before you can actually taste the dish and figure out how much more to add. If you taste your dish before the salt has had time to dissolve then the dish will appear to be less salty than it actually is.</li>
                    <li>Keep two kinds of salt on hand: kosher or bulk-bin sea salt for everyday cooking, special flaky salt with a nice texture to use as a garnish</li>
                    <li>Salt unlocks hidden flavors and reduces our perception of bitterness (better than sugar does)</li>
                    <li>Taste and adjust salt level as you cook</li>
                    <li>How Salt Works</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Osmosis: the movement of water across a cell wall from the less salty side to the saltier side</li>
                      <li>Diffusion: slower process of salt moving from a saltier environment to a less salty one until it’s evenly distributed throughout. </li>
                      <li>When we sprinkle salt on meat and wait, the diffusion will create a balance of salt inside the meat and outside it, resulting in it tasting evenly seasoned. Water will also move on the outside of the meat due to osmosis. (In other words, wait enough time for diffusion to occur when you salt something!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Some think that salt dries out meat due to osmosis. However, (with time) disrupts the protein structure of meet and prevents it from densely coagulating when heated. This allows the water molecules on the outside of the proteins to remain bound so that the meat remains moist when cooked.</li>
                    <li>Salting most meats a day in advance is a good idea. The larger, denser, or more sinewy the meet is the more in advance you should salt it. Also the colder the environment where the salt is, the longer the reaction with salt will take.</li>
                    <li>If you salt meat for too long it will dry out and become cured.</li>
                    <li>Seafood can’t handle salting for long in advance, so just salt it for 15 minutes before cooking</li>
                    <li>Fatty parts have less water than the muscle and other parts of meat, so the fat doesn’t absorb salt as well. Just be mindful of this if you have fatty meat. If you want to add salt to mayonnaise or something, then you can just add an ingredient that has more water content for the salt to be absorbed easier.</li>
                    <li>Vegetable and fruit cells contain an undigestible carbohydrate called pectin which can be softened by cooking and with salt.</li>
                    <li>More water in food = quicker salt absorption so just be mindful of this</li>
                    <li>Salt strengthens gluten, the protein that makes dough chewy and flexible</li>
                    <li>Salt the water you use to blanch/boil and taste the water after letting the salt dissolve to know how much more salt to add. You salt this water for the same diffusion reasons.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes you can add salt in the form of a salty ingredient like Parmesan or anchovies. Always taste food to see what it needs more of.</li>
                    <li>If you oversalt, add more unsalty ingredients to your food that will absorb some of the salt.</li>
                    <li>If you want to experiment adding stuff to your food, you can take just a part of it and experiment with just that part. Then if it tastes good make the adjustment to the whole dish</li>
                  </ul>
              <h2>FAT</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li> Fats can act as a main ingredient, a cooking medium, and a seasoning </li>
                  <li> Fats have significant influences on flavor and texture in dishes based on their impact on  chemical reactions in cooking. </li>
                  <li> Cooking fats can be heated to extreme temperatures which allows the surface temperature of foods cooked in them to climb to astonishing heights which makes the foods crispy and golden brown. Water can’t withstand high heats like this to let food brown. </li>
                  <li> Canola oil is a good cooking oil because it doesn’t taste like anything and has a high smoke point (can withstand high temperature before smoking). </li>
                  <li> Some fats can enrich flavor when added to food just before serving it.</li>
                  <li> Fat coats the tongue which allows aromatic compounds to stay in contact with our taste buds for longer.</li>
                  <li> Animal fat is more aromatic and tastes more like meat than its lean meat. So, it is typically mixed in with meats to make them more rich and moist</li>
                  <li> Fats that are within the animals muscle (marbling)  melt away when cooked, enhancing the flavor of the meat. However, clumps of fat that are separate are perhaps layered between groups of muscle  and just external do not taste good when cooked. You can take these chunks of fat and melt them down to be used as a cooking medium (that will lend the meaty flavor to what you cook in it)</li>
                  <li> Which fats we use determines the flavor, and how we use them determines the texture</li>
                  <li> Some foods release fat and others absorb it when cooking. Make sure that there is always enough to cook the food with.</li>
                  <li> As oil is heated it breaks down leading to flavor degradation and the release of toxic chemicals. So, heat your pan first and then put oil on just when you’re ready to cook. (Don’t do this with butter though because it will burn).</li>
                  <li> When cooking meats with fat inside them, make sure to cook slowly enough to give the fat enough time to render (cooked until water inside the fat has evaporated), because this can prevent meat from crisping. Also make sure every part of the meat is cooked so the fat can render.</li>
                  <li> Butter is an emulsion of water and fat and the water and fat naturally want to separate. This is what happens when butter melts. This is why the temperature of butter in recipes is important, because the emulsion impacts dishes differently</li>
                  <li> To emulsify, you break down the large molecules and join together the smaller ones which you can form by whisking</li>
                  <li> People knead dough and mix batter to lengthen chains of gluten which makes the bread chewier.. Sugar and acids discourage gluten development. Fat can also inhibit gluten networks from forming. This is the reason for the term shortening (as in shortbread cookies), because these doughs have little gluten development due to flour and fat being intimately melded together. Melting butter into dough can also encourage gluten development if the water molecules get absorbed into the flour.</li>
                  <li> Important to wait for oven to preheat before you stick in baked goods so that the water in the butter can quickly evaporate and the filling doesn’t make the baked good soggy.</li>
                  <li> When baking you can whip together butter to trap air bubbles into your batter. Don’t go too fast though or it will create heat through friction. If the butter gets too hot the butter emulsion will break and if the butter is too cold air con’t be able to mix into the batter. Baking soda/powder help expand air bubbles already in batter by releasing CO2, they don’t add any new air bubbles so incorporating air is important to leaven your baked good.</li>
                </ul>
              <h2>ACID</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li> Of the five basic tastes acid causes our mouths to water the most because our mouths flood with saliva to balance the acidity which is bad for our teeth.</li>
                  <li> Acid balances: consider lemonade with only lemon juice and water. This will be gross and acidic until we add sugar, then it will be yummy, however the pH of the liquid will remain the same after the sugar. </li>
                  <li> Acid dulls vibrant greens, but it can prevent oxidation (enzymatic browning from oxygen exposure) of raw fruits and vegetables with soaking</li>
                  <li> Acid keeps vegetables and legumes tougher or longer and make them cook more slowly since they have cellulose or pectin.</li>
                  <li> Baking soda can making cooking water more alkaline (more resistance to changes in acidity)</li>
                  <li> Acid encourages bonds between pectin groups so that they can trap water to help set jam/jelly</li>
                  <li> Chemical leavenings like baking soda/powder need acid to react and release CO2</li>
                  <li> Acid encourages proteins in egg white to coagulate which inhibits them from tightening when cooking and squeezing out water. </li>
                  <li> Acid can encourage more, finer air pockets in whipped egg whites</li>
                  <li> Acid prevents fluent development</li>
                  <li> When acid comes into contact with proteins it uncoils them (tenderizing meat), then continued exposure will cause the uncoil strands to tangle and coagulate (toughening the meat).</li>
                  <li> Acid can help break down collagen (the main structural protein in touch cuts of meat) which allows meat to become more tender</li>
                  <li> Browning floods creates some acid, fermentation also creates acid</li>
                  <li> Always balance sweetness with acid. This is why chocolate and coffee make great bases for something sweet because they themselves are bitter and rich in umami</li>
                  <li> Acid must not only balance with the dish itself, but the whole meal. It must complement the other things you eat in the meal</li>
                </ul>
              <h2>HEAT</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li> Pay attention to the food not the heat to know how to adjust the heat </li>
                  <li> Heat is energy: it gives the particles in your food energy making the molecules speed up and sometimes break apart to meet with new atoms and form new molecules</li>
                  <li> When food has too much water the flavor will be diluted and by cooking the food longer you can reduce it (lower the water content to make it richer in flavor)</li>
                  <li> When frozen water expands. When you see ice crystals have formed on your food in the freezer, this is a result of water within the cells expanding and forcing the cell walls to burst, releasing the water which forms ice crystals on the surface.</li>
                  <li> Trapping steam can keep the food moist and prevent browning. </li>
                  <li> Salt can draw out the water win food with osmosis, which can create steam. Be mindful of this when choosing when to salt.</li>
                  <li> Fat is slow to cool and heat.</li>
                  <li> The starchiest parts of plants need to cook slowly in water since starches absorb liquid and swell/break down</li>
                  <li> As heat penetrates say a boiling carrot, its starches break down into simple sugars and the cell walls enclosing these sugars disintegrate which frees them to reach our taste buds more readily</li>
                  <li> The small number of sugars that vegetables contain begin to disappear and convert to starch the moment they are picked. Nothing we can do about this since we can only buy ingredients from the grocery store, but it’s interesting.</li>
                  <li> Preserve tender cuts of meat with careful, quick cooking using intense heat (don’t let tender red meat get to internal temperature over 140F (160 for chicken) or else the proteins will coagulate and expel water and being chewy and overcooked)</li>
                  <li> Tougher cuts of meat need to be cooked on low heat for a long time. Heat will transform collagen into gelatin with water and time, making the meat tender.</li>
                  <li> Maillard reaction</li>
                  <li> You can use intense heat to brown the surface of tough cuts of meat and then switch to low heat to cook the inside or do the inverse. Either is good.</li>
                  <li> The temperature of food when you start cooking has a dramatic impact on the food when you cook it. Chicken is much more dense than hot over air, so cooking it straight from the fridge vs when it’s room temperature will make the cook time longer and which can dry it out.</li>
                  <li> Heat degrades the cell walls of food releasing aromas.</li>
                  <li> Use stainless steel or cast iron when searing meat (not nonstick) and don’t use that much fat since it is less of a cooking medium and more about getting uniform contact between meat and pan (not from book). Searing is really only used to get Maillard reaction, and doesnt actually cook meat that much which is why it’s great for steak </li>
                  <li> If the amount of liquid you are reducing is more than 3 inches deep, using multiple pots will quicken reduction by allowing steam to escape more quickly. This will also reduce how much the flavor changes by</li>
                  <li> Stirring dissipates heat which will prevent the Maillard reaction</li>
                  <li> Never cook directly over the flame when grilling. This introduces carcinogens into the food.</li>
                  <li> Let meat rest for a bit after cooking which gives the proteins time to relax and retain water better.</li>
                  <li> When you first bake goodies, high temperatures will cause water to vaporize into steam which will push apart layers of baking dough and give your food much more volume. </li>
                  <li> Be careful not to make oven too hot or fats can catch on fire</li>
                  <li> Foods that require long exposure to gentle heat are cooked in advance and reheated while delicate foods that cook quickly are cooked to order.</li>
                  <li> When fat starts sputtering (not sizzling) this can mean it’s time to flip meat or tip some fat out of the pan</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Although things like #MeToo are meant to unite women together and promote a good cause something like that can take the significance and individually out of people’s stories and make the issue not seem as real or interesting. It’s the idea of grouping people who have had a bad date and who have been raped into the same words, people may think this is the case and it turns people off. Especially in today’s society when it seems like many people express solidarity just as an ego boost and as a performance to make yourself likeable.</li>
                        <li>Social media was constructed around the idea that a thing is important insofar as it is important to you.</li>
                        <li>Beauty is an important standard for women in society. Modern feminism has pushed the idea that everyone is beautiful, instead of challenging the idea that beauty isn’t important. It’s interesting because in a way it is accepting the idea that beauty is extremely important.</li>
                        <li>Teenage heroines in young adult books (like twilight) display cases where a girl’s life revolved around her desirability, who had no life of her own and was completely absorbed into the life and problems of the man she loved (a common trope). This one of Jia Tolentino's points made me reflect on what I had just read in "Becoming". The incredibly bright Michelle Obama, who was Barack Obama’s senior and direct supervisor at a law firm, is then sort of forced to go along with his ambition. In her view of marriage, Michelle said she viewed marriage as mutual sacrifice for the family, whereas Barack places more emphasis on the freedom and aspirations of the individuals in the relationship. She hypothesized that this difference in opinions was due to their upbringings (which is definitely true), but I have to wonder if this is also partially ingrained in the our culture's gender roles. Maybe women are expected to give up things for the sake of marriage whereas men are not. This is a bummer and pretty unfair.</li>
                        <li>Adriana Cavarero says that identity is not something that we innately possess and reveal, but something we understand through narratives provided to us by others. In the Odyssey, Ulysses only cries when he hears a stranger narrate the Trojan War, because only then does he realize it’s significance.</li>
                        <li>People use their parents as a base from which to become something more. Maybe children define how to become that something more in different ways, depending on who their parents are and how they view them. I feel like I’m lucky that I have a place to grow. My parents weren’t analytical or technical and I feel like that’s where I can improve. How will my own children? Is there conflict between my own desire for constant self improvement and a child wanting to improve to surpass me?</li>
                        <li>Women in history have always been introduced from a male perspective. This is also true with something like typical interpretations of the Bible. It’s interesting how stories and perceptions change once you adopt the woman’s perspective.</li>
                        <li>Jia Tolentino states that women who are difficult and unruly for selfish reasons are venerated for their selfish reasons or even for doing nothing. For example, Kim Kardashian is popular because she is an absurd sex symbol which means that she’s criticized. For example Ivanka Trump gets so much praise for doing nothing. She was a model and now she works in the government. Jia Tolentino says that there is a trend where these women are criticized for something related to them being a woman and then her continued existence is interpreted as politically meaningful. What about a fat women in power for example: I’d think wow it’s great that a fat women has the confidence and ability to be in power! If it was a man I’d never have that thought.</li>
                        <li>The Trump administration has been using feminism like a shield to shut down criticism.</li>
                        <li>The important thing about sexism is that it is inherent in our culture and thoughts. It is applied to every woman everywhere in every situation because it changes the perspective we have. It’s not an abnormality it’s the way things are.</li>

                        <li>Michelle Obama mentions being labeled as “an angry black women” and the stereotypes that just looking how she looks would be enforced whereas others wouldn’t have to worry about that. She also talks about double standards of how tabloids and people would comment about her outfits but they wouldn’t care about Barack’s. Crazy stuff.

                        <li>When having sex with someone you don’t think about who you could be having sex with, even though you may think you are missing out when sitting around thinking about being with that person.</li>

                        <li>Similar to how genes that encourage sex would be passed on to more people, statements/beliefs that promote stable society even if they are true or false would be passed on through communication like DNA replication</li>

                    <li>Tennis is quite a mentally taxing game by itself, but mixing in the pressure from Andre Agassi's personal life (like his crazy father), I have no idea how he was able to become so great. I was on the edge of my seat when he was giving play-by-plays of some of his most famous matches, because I didn't actually know who won. It was also incredible to learn about what he was thinking and feeling during these matches. Like for example how he had to get cortisol shots in his back hours before a match when he was older. We put a lot of pressure on athletes to just go out and perform, but we don't realize the mental and physical hurdles that these athletes have to overcome off the court. </li>
                    <li>The most important thing I took away from this book is the sentim that there is always another match. I wish I had realized this when I was younger and still training my tennis. 
                      I used to put way too mmuch pressure on myself to win and perform well, which actually worked to my detriment. I would get too frustrated if I missed a few shots and my mental game would fall apart. I didn't really enjoy playing because of the pressure I put on myself, which resulted in me not training as hard and taking away little from my matches.</li>

                    <li>Conventionally, when I teach myself something I like to see tangible results quickly. However, short term retention is actually a very bad indicator of how much you pick up in the long term. Apparently, slow and painful learning does the best at teaching something and having that stick with you.</li>
                    <li>I would like to improve my long term retention for things that I learn, and apparently this can be done with interleaved training. Interleaved and varied training is better than repeatedly doing the same task for long periods of time (block training). Block training you are primed to give a certain response, but with interleaved training you actually need to think about your response.</li>

                    <li>Enlighenment Now clearly explained many controversial topics as well as dispelled many misconceptions I had about the state of modern society. I feel much more knowledgable about what's going on in today's world and also more confident in the ability of our society to combat the major problems that the world faces.</li>
                    <li>Firstly, income inequality has indeed grown over time, however everyone's income (and buying power) has been rising. The wealth disparity should be addressed, but the standard of living for everyone continues to improve which I'm quite happy about.</li>
                    <li>I had a very negative perception of nuclear power prior to reading this book. As it turns out, the deaths resulting from harnessing nuclear power are miniscule compared to the number of deaths resulting from most kinds of other energy. Using nuclear power is also much more efficient than using other forms of energy, although the amount of carbon dioxide and methane released per unit of energy has dramatically decreased for all forms of energy.</li>
                    <li>Steven Pinker claims that the emphasis that we place on terrorist attacks reveals how benign society really is, since they make up a very small proportion of deaths (also that Terrorism is intended to provoke, whereas military force is intended to weaken).</li>
                    <li>Millennials use less drugs than Baby Boomers, despite common perceptions.</li>
                    <li>The best predictor of democratic values and emancipation in a society is the World Bank's knowledge index. This could imply a causal relationship between knowledge/progress and democracy where societies are all approaching democracy as they further develop (take this with a grain of salt).</li>
                    <li>Society has been improving over the long term, despite short term fluctuations. Progress is self-cloaking in that solving a problem gives rise to new ones.</li>
                    <li>I found this to be quite surprising: there is no correlation between people's understanding of climate change and whether or not they believe in it. Mostly, those who do not believe in climate change (or support Donald Trump for example) do so because of their personal values and identity, not due to a lack of understanding.</li>

                      Some of the applications of this are really crazy, like in the future we will be able to draw someones blood, convert those blood cells into some egg cells and sperm cells and then create a child made completely from that person. Freaky.</li>

                          <li>Before I read this book, I only knew about the legend of Leonardo Da Vinci, the quintessential “Renaissance Man” and creator of some of the most famous art pieces in history. It was difficult to conceptualize him as an actual human being.</li>
                          <li>The author did a great job of demystifying who Leonardo was by extensive research through his journals. I was quite surprised to learn that Leonardo was an erratic and frenzied thinker, who never completed his commissioned work.</li>
                          <li>Leonardo had a fascinating mind, which the book explored intimately through Leonardo’s notebooks. His disorderly, meandering, and flurried notes posited some really odd questions that I never would have thought to ask. I was inspired to be more inquisitive about the way things work.</li>
                          <li>Leonardo curiosity drove him explore optics, anatomy, art, engineering and many other fields, and his knowledge in one field complemented his abilities in the next, making him a true polymath.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This book has had a pretty significant influence on my interests overall, what I chose study in college, and my career path, because it gave me a new, refreshing perspective of math. Before reading this book I thought that math was pretty boring, and I didn't have much of an interest in applying math to situations in my daily life or pursuing a career focused on building mathematical models.</li>
                            <li>Jordan Ellenberg illuminates many misconcpetions about math that I had growing up. You don't need to be a prodigy to be an accomplished mathematician, math is actually quite useful in every day life, and math can be fun.</li>
                            <li>Most importantly the book examines some problems that seem simple and boring at first, but when looked at through a mathematical perspective become quite interesting.</li>
                            <li>Some of my favorite questions this booked examined include: is there a definitive way to say that an elected candidate is the "correct" candidate, are there secret messages hidden in patterns within holy texts, and Buffon's needle.</li>

                            <li>In school, I found history to be pretty boring, because there wasn't much analysis on why events transpired. Instead, the focus in school was about what had happened. In this book, Harari uncompromisingly presents his opinions surrounding humanity's evolution, which makes the story of humanity so much more compelling.</li>
                            <li>I learned so much about how society has evolved since humans emerged from monkeys. The book also made me reflect on what makes us truly human and where humanity is headed in the future.</li>
